Mofidico linea en del fichero config en 

C:\Users\d698760\.jupyter




cd into the directory or a parent directory (with the intended directory you will work nested in it).

Note it must be a folder (E:\> --- This will not work)

Then just run the command jupyter notebook




Well. I just wrote .bat file where first line is cd path_to_my_starting_folder and second line is jupyter notebook(in your case it is probably ipython notebook) and my problem was solved.



Open cmd (or Anaconda Prompt) and run jupyter notebook --generate-config.

This writes a file to C:\Users\username\.jupyter\jupyter_notebook_config.py.

Browse to the file location and open it in an Editor

Search for the following line in the file: #c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = ''

Replace by c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = '/the/path/to/home/folder/'
